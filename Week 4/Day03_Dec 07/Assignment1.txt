1.   What is BOM? What is the difference between DOM and BOM?

	
     > The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a browser-specific convention referring to all the objects exposed by the web browser.
     > The BOM allows JavaScript to “interact with” the browser.
     > The object of the window represents a browser window and all its corresponding features.
     > A window object is created automatically by the browser itself.
     > Java Script’s window.screen object contains information about the user’s screen.


     Following are the differences between DOM and BOM : 

   
     > DOM means Document Object model.
       When the webpage is loaded the browser creates a document object model for the page.
       All the objects are arranged as tree structure.

       BOM means Browser Object Model.
       Window object is supported by all browsers it represents the window browser.
       All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
   
     
     > They're just different objects you're dealing with:

      	  The DOM is the Document Object Model, which deals with the document, the HTML elements themselves,
          e.g. document and all traversal you would do in it, events, etc.

          The BOM is the Browser Object Model, which deals with browser components aside from the document,
          like history, location, navigator and screen (as well as some others that vary by browser).


2.   What is event target property in javascript?


     > The event.target property helps find the name of the HTML element used to trigger the event.
     > For example, if we call a function from an HTML element click event, we can determine the specified element name to trigger and call a function.
     > To get that property, we call event.target and store it in a variable like let variable = event.target.
     > It returns a reference to the object on which the event occurred.
