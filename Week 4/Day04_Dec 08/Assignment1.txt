1.   What is Regular Expression in JavaScript? How to validate email id using Regular Expression?


     A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
     The search pattern can be used for text search and text to replace operations.
     A regular expression can be a single character or a more complicated pattern.
     Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

     
     Approach 1:

     RegExp – It checks for the valid characters in the Email-Id (like, numbers, alphabets, few special characters.)
     It is allowing every special symbol in the email-id (like, !, #, $, %, ^, &, *) symbols in the Email-Id but not allowing the second @ symbol in ID.

     Approach 2:

     RegExp – It checks for the pattern like anything@anything.anything
     Not like the previous example, RegExp is accepting every character along with special character multiple times.
