1.   How to hide html element using JavaScript?


     There are three ways of hiding an element using javascript. They are: 

     > Using the hidden property
          In JavaScript, the hidden property of an element is used to hide an element.
          We set the hidden properties value to true to hide the element.

	      Syntax
	          Following is the syntax to use hidden property −

                  document.getElementById('element').hidden = true
 
     > Using the style.display property
	  In JavaScript, style.display property is also used to hide the HTML element.
          It can have values like ‘block,’ ‘inline,’ ‘inline-block,’ etc., but the value used to hide an element is ‘none.’
          Using JavaScript, we set the style.display property value to ‘none’ to hide html element.

             Syntax
	         Following is the syntax to hide HTML elements using style.display property in JavaScript.

	         document.getElementById('element').style.display = 'none'

     > Using the style.visibility property
          In JavaScript, style.visibility property is also used to hide the HTML element.
          It can have values like ‘visible,’ ‘collapse,’ ‘hidden’, ‘initial’ etc., but the value used to hide an element is ‘hidden’.
          Using JavaScript, we set the style.visibility property value to ‘hidden’ to hide html element.

            Syntax
                Following is the syntax to hide HTML elements using style.visibility property in JavaScript −

2.   How to change text color of all paragraphs in the document using JavaScript?


     We can change the color of all the paragraphs using javascript in the following ways: 
 
     > document.getElementsByTagName("tagname");
     > document.querySelectorAll("p");

     Now, as both the fns return array of objects, so iterate through the array and change the color for each object.

     > It refers to DOM elements	                              It also refers to DOM elements.
     > this is used in a native way.	                              this is put in $(), it becomes a jQuery object.
     > We can call all DOM methods on it but not jQuery methods.      We can call all jQuery methods and functions on it but not DOM methods.
     > this has only generic JavaScript functionality.	              By using $(this), you enabled jQuery functionality for the object.
