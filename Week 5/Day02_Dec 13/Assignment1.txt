1.   What is setInterval()  and setTimeout() methods in JavaScript?
     

     > JavaScript setTimeout() calls a method after a certain period of milliseconds have passed.\
     > The method is only called once. 
     > The setTimeout() method lets you introduce delays into your code.

     Letâ€™s take a look at the syntax for this method:

     window.setTimeout(function, time);

     The two parameters accepted by setTimeout are:

     function : The function you want to execute after a period of time has passed.
     time : The amount of time your program should wait before executing a function.


     > The JavaScript setInterval() method calls a function repeatedly.
     > A specified delay is set between each time a function is called.

     setInterval() uses a similar syntax to setTimeout():

     window.setInterval(function, time);

     You must specify two parameters to use setInterval:

     function: The function that will be executed.
     time: The time between each call of the function you have specified.


2.   What is Asynchronous?


     Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed immediately where the synchronous code will block further execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one.
