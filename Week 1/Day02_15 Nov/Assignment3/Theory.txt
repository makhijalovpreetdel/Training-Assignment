1.   How to apply style to first letter of the paragraph?


     To style the first letter of a word, we can use the pseudo-element, p::first-letter.

     p::first-letter { font-size:28px; }

2.   Why do we use  ~  and >  symbols in css selectors?

	
     > selector
     
     The greater than sign (>) selector in CSS is used to select the element with a specific parent. 
     It is called as element > element selector.
     It is also known as the child combinator selector which means that it selects only those elements which are direct children of a parent.
 
     div>p means apply the styling to the p tag which is a direct child of div tag.


     ~ selector
     
     It is general sibling combinator and similar to Adjacent sibling combinator.
     The difference is that the second selector does NOT have to immediately follow the first one means It will select all elements that is preceded by the former selector.
     
     div~p means apply the styling to the all the p tags that are its siblings.
