1. How to display images in title bar?

Steps involved are : 


   a. The image must be square dimensioned in any image format (ico, jpg, bmp, gif, png) to appear in browsers properly. Images with non-square dimensions will also work. However, such icons may not look professional.
   
   b. You must convert your image into the .ico format. There are many online tools to do that.

   c. Opening the tool, you must upload your image file. Then, the image will be converted automatically.
   
   d. Download the image and save your .ico file on the computer.

   e. Rename the file to favicon.ico, because the browser automatically recognizes only this name.

   f. Upload the file to the host directory, where your website files are located.

   g. When your favicon.ico file is uploaded, the browser will select it automatically and display the image in the browser.


2. What is the purpose of "alt" attribute of img tag?


   The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
