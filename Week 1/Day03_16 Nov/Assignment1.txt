1.   What is Validation in Client Side Programming?

2.   What are the advantages of performing Validations?


     The main advantage of client-side validation is that it requires no HTTP request/response cycle since it all takes place on the client’s machine,
     and thus near instantaneous feedback may be provided.

     Client-side validation can provide a responsive, intuitive and smooth user experience.

     If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.
